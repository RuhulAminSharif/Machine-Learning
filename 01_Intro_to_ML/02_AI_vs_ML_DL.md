| **Definition**             | AI is the overall concept of creating intelligent machines that simulate human intelligence and make decisions.                           | ML is a subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data patterns without explicit programming.                                                       | DL is a further subset of ML, utilizing neural networks to learn complex patterns from data, inspired by the human brain.      |
| **Learning Process**       | Involves various approaches to simulate intelligence, often including ML and DL techniques.                              | Trains systems on labeled data to identify patterns and relationships, often through supervised learning.                                                   | Uses deep neural networks with multiple layers to extract complex features, can use both supervised and unsupervised learning. |
| **Focus**                  | Building systems that can think, learn, adapt, and make decisions like humans.                                    | Developing algorithms that allow systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on past experiences.                                    | Specializes in identifying complex patterns, particularly in unstructured data like images, text, and sound.                   |
| **Techniques**             | Rule-based systems, decision trees, expert systems, robotics.                                                   | Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms.                                                      | Neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).                           |
| **Data Requirements**      | Varies; can work with rules or limited data but benefits from larger datasets.                                   | Needs large datasets to generalize and make accurate predictions.                                                      | Requires vast datasets to accurately model complex patterns and relationships.                                                |
| **Computational Power**    | Moderate; often runs on CPUs, sometimes with GPU support.                                                      | Higher than traditional AI, can benefit from GPU support for larger datasets.                                          | Very high; relies on GPUs or TPUs for handling large amounts of data and complex computations.                               |
| **Example in Self-Driving Cars** | Combines outputs from ML and DL to make driving decisions, plan routes, control speed, and interact with passengers.               | Identifies objects on the road, predicts other vehiclesâ€™ behavior based on historical data, assists with object detection and obstacle avoidance.           | Recognizes objects in images, analyzes sensor data to detect obstacles and anticipate changes in the environment.              |
| **Real-Life Use Case**     | Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), facial recognition, recommendation systems.                                  | Spam detection, credit scoring, product recommendations.                                                              | Self-driving cars, medical imaging analysis, natural language processing.                                                     |
| **Overall Role in AI**     | AI is the broadest category, encompassing ML and DL as methods to achieve intelligent systems.                 | ML is a technique within AI to enable systems to improve based on data without explicit programming.                    | DL is a specialized ML approach effective in handling unstructured data and complex relationships.                            |
