## What is Machine Learning  

**Machine learning** is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks over time without being explicitly programmed. By using algorithms to analyze patterns in data, machines can make predictions or decisions with minimal human intervention.  

**Example**: A popular example of machine learning is email spam detection. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled emailsâ€”some marked as spam and others as not spam. By analyzing patterns in the text, subject lines, and sender information, the model learns to identify characteristics of spam emails. Once trained, it can classify new incoming emails as either spam or not spam, helping users keep their inboxes clean and organized.
