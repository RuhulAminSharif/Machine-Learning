## Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDLC)
MLDLC is a framework for developing machine learning models in a structured and systematic way. It includes several steps, from problem definition to deployment, that are focused to build robust, accurate, and scalable machine learning models.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to solving a machine learning problem using the Machine Learning Development Cycle (MLDC), illustrated with an example of predicting house prices:

### 1. **Frame the Problem**
   - **Objective**: Define the problem, goals, and performance metrics.
   - **Example**: Suppose we want to build a model that predicts house prices based on features like bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts the price, using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate performance.

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - **Objective**: Collect relevant data from various sources.
   - **Example**: For predicting house prices, data can be sourced from real estate websites, public datasets, or web scraping tools to obtain information on home features and sale prices.  
  
(Data can be in csv format, or can be collected using API, web scraping, database to data ware house via ETL.)

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Objective**: Clean and prepare data for modeling.
   - **Example**: Remove duplicate values, remove rows with missing values, encode categorical features like location using encoding, and scale numerical features like square footage and lot size to standardize them, remove outliers.

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Objective**: Understand the data distribution and relationships among features.
   - **Example**: Visualize relationships using scatter plots (e.g., between square footage and price) and histograms to see the distribution of features and identify patterns that influence house prices.
  
(visualization, univariate, bi-variate, multivariate, outlier detection, imbalance -> balance)

### 5. **Feature Engineering and Selection**
   - **Objective**: Create and select features that improve model performance.
   - **Example**: Create new features like “house age” or “bathroom-to-bedroom ratio.” Use correlation analysis or feature importance scores to select the most impactful features for predicting prices.

### 6. **Model Training, Evaluation, and Selection**
   - **Objective**: Train models, evaluate their performance, and select the best one.
   - **Example**: Train models like Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression. Evaluate them using metrics such as MSE or R-squared, and select the model with the best performance based on these metrics.

### 7. **Model Deployment**
   - **Objective**: Deploy the model in a production environment.
   - **Example**: Deploy the house price prediction model on a website or app where users can input house features and receive a predicted price.

### 8. **Testing and Optimization**
   - **Objective**: Continuously test and optimize the model in production.
   - **Example**: Regularly test the model on new data to ensure accuracy. If performance drops, retrain or update the model with new data or features to improve accuracy.

By following these steps, we can systematically build, deploy, and maintain a machine learning model that solves real-world problems effectively.
