### Standardization

#### Geometric Intuition Behind Standardization
Standardization transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Geometrically, this can be visualized as shifting and scaling the data points so that they are centered around the origin (mean = 0) and spread out in a way that each feature has the same variance. This transformation ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model, preventing any feature with a large range from dominating the learning process.  

**Note:** There will be no change in distribution for an individual feature. But helpful to identify co-relation between features.

#### Impact of Outliers in Standardization
Outliers can significantly affect the mean and standard deviation of a dataset, which in turn can distort the results of standardization. Since standardization relies on these statistics, the presence of outliers can lead to a misleading representation of the data. For instance, extreme values can inflate the standard deviation, causing most of the data points to be scaled down excessively. This can make the model less sensitive to the majority of the data and more sensitive to the outliers.

#### How Important is Standardization?
Standardization is crucial in many machine learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on distance metrics or gradients, such as:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Ensures that no feature disproportionately influences the distance calculations.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Helps in optimizing the decision boundary by treating each feature equally.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Ensures that each feature contributes equally to the variance calculation.
- **Gradient Descent-Based Algorithms**: Improves the convergence rate by ensuring that the cost function gradients are on a similar scale.

#### When to Use Standardization
1. **Algorithms Sensitive to Feature Scale**: Use standardization for algorithms like KNN, SVM, PCA, and neural networks where the scale of the features can affect performance.
2. **Data with Normal Distribution**: Standardization works well when the data follows a Gaussian distribution or is approximately normal.
3. **Mixed Feature Ranges**: When the dataset contains features with different ranges, standardization ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model.
4. **Gradient Descent Optimization**: When using algorithms that involve gradient descent, standardization helps in achieving faster and more stable convergence.
